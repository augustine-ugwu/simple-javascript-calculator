This program is a simple calculator that allows the user to input two numbers and an operator,and then performs a mathematical operation on the numbers using the specified operator.

The documentation for the source code is as follows:
The program prompts the user to enter an operator (either +, -, *, or /) using the prompt() function, and stores the result in the operator variable.
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using the prompt() function, and stores the results in the number1 and number2 variables after converting them from strings to numbers using the parseFloat() function.
The program declares a result variable without assigning a value to it.
The program uses conditional statements to check the value of the operator variable and perform the appropriate mathematical operation on number1 and number2. If operator is equal to "+", the program adds number1 and number2 and stores the result in the result variable. If operator is equal to "-", the program subtracts number2 from number1 and stores the result in the result variable. If operator is equal to "*", the program multiplies number1 and number2 and stores the result in the result variable. If operator is not equal to any of the above values, the program divides number1 by number2 and stores the result in the result variable.
The program uses the prompt() function to display the result of the mathematical operation in a popup message box. The message box includes a string that contains the values of number1, operator, number2, and result interpolated using the ${} syntax.

Overall, this program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers using a simple calculator interface.
